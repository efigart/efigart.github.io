## Overview 

**Project Janus** is a web-based application designed to help UH Manoa students (particularly computer science and engineering) discover internship and job opportunites.
Additionally, it also allows for networking with companies, and even fellow students. The primary goal was to make the job-search and netwroking process more streamlined and accesible. 

In the app, both students and companies are able to create accounts. Students can input their personal information, intrests, and links to thier professional profile. Companies are also able to add information to give students a breif idea of what they are about. Additionally, they are able to create job listings, these listings contain all the relavent information, from salary to the amount of postions available. Students are able to view all of the avalible job options and select any that fit their needs / intrests. 

This app was developed as a Final Project for ICS 314.
