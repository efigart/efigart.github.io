## Overview 

**Project Janus** is a web-based application designed to help UH Manoa students (particularly computer science and engineering) discover internship and job opportunites.
Additionally, it also allows for networking with companies, and even fellow students. The primary goal was to make the job-search and netwroking process more streamlined and accesible. 

In the app, both students and companies are able to create accounts. Students can input their personal information, intrests, and links to thier professional profile. Companies are also able to add information to give students a breif idea of what they are about. Additionally, they are able to create job listings, these listings contain all the relavent information, from salary to the amount of postions available. Students are able to view all of the avalible job options and select any that fit their needs / intrests. 

This app was developed as a Final Project for ICS 314.

## Contributions 

I developed this web application along with 3 other classmates. Using issue driven project management, we were able to create issues for each requirment of the project, and assign  each of them to one of us. Thsi ensured everything was accounted for, and done well in a relatively timely manner. Here is a list of some of the taks I contributed:

- Created mockups for the landing page + student home page
- Implemnted functionality to the navbar, assigning certain pages to certain user types
- Converted html mockups to react 
- Fixed a error where the navbar was repeating items
- Implement functionality to the landing page
- Implement functionality to the student home page (pulling data from schema)
- Update the githiub.io site to reflect verious changes / requirments

Most of my work was front-end based, while my classmates were focused on the back-end. I think we all did our fare share of work, and I enjoyed working with them.

Here is a screenshot of the student-home page I created. It pulls data from the schema of the student account. Implementing functionality took many attempts.
