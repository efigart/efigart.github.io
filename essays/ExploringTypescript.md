## Intro 

This semester I started learning Typescript. Learning a new coding language is always an exciting experience. However, it can also present many challenges, especially in an educational environment. Prior to this I only had experience with Java and C. I have never coded in Typescript, or even Javascript before. Thankfully it was relatively easy to pick up, most of the logic and most of the syntax is similar to what I already know. I am excited to increase my affinity with it over the course of the semester.


## Perspective 

I am still relatively new to Typescript, so my opinions and perspective may not be fully formed yet. With that being said, one of my favorite things about it is the immediate error detection. This allows me to catch mistakes early, which allows me to correct and helps prevent the same mistake in the future. This feature is noticeably absent in Java and C. I think it is especially helpful for beginners. Another thing I like is the flexibility, type definitions can be omitted and functions can have multiple return values. It seems minor but it was helpful during practice exercises.  


## Workout of the Day

Another new experience I had was athletic software engineering. I definitely have some mixed feelings about this. On the surface, I do enjoy being given a challenge and having to come up with a solution in a set amount of time. I think it is a great way to practice and it encourages information retention. I have heard similar things about LeetCode, I plan to explore that once I gain more experience. Moving on, the main downside for me is the all-or-nothing grade. It definitely adds a lot of stress and pressure, which could inhibit my performance. Despite this, I still think it is a good exercise that will be beneficial to my learning. 

## Conclusion

Overall, I think Typescript is an essential language that students, or anyone interested in software development should learn. It is a great place to start and can also serve as a stepping stone into other languages. I am excited to learn and gain more experience as the semester goes on.
