## Overview

### Problem

Parking at Zone-20 can sometimes be challenging. After a certain time, especially on certain days, finding an open spot can be very difficult. This is primarily impacts students who have classes later in the day. 

### Solution

This idea is built / expanded off the parking-reservation project that was mentioned during class. InsertName is an application that allows students to track availiable spots in Zone-20.

- when students arrive (presumably in the morning) they can input their stall number / location into the app
- when they leave, they can open the app and mark their spot as available
- students arriving later in the day (when the lot is relatively full) can open the app and view a list of available spots, eliminting the need to endlessly circle the lot
- if they take a spot listed on the app, they can mark it as taken and it will be removed from the list of avaiable spots

## Approach

To preface, this application would be on a voulantary bases. I don't think it would be realistic to expect eveyrone who parks in Zone-20 to particpate. Also, in order for this to work, there would have to be some sort of numbering system for the stalls. 

Although non-students also utilize the lot, the main purpose of this app is to assist students. So this application can only be accessed with an account created with a UH email.

This appliction would have two user groups: Students and Admin. Students can veiw / add avaibale spots. Admins have access to to the full site + data. 

Some possible mockup pages include:

- landing page
- view avilable spots
- add spot
- remove spot
- admin home page

## Use Case Ideas

- a new user arrves at the landing page and is prompted to make an account
- a user opens the "add spot" page, and inputs their stall number / location
- later, the same user opens the "remove spot" page and marks their spot as avialable
- a different user arrives, logs in / creates an account, and opens the "view available spots" page
- they pick from the list of spots and drive to it, if it is available, they park, open the "add spot" page, and input their stall number / location
- the stall is removed from the "view avilable spots page"
