## Overview

### Problem

Parking at Zone-20 can sometimes be challenging. After a certain time, especially on certain days, finding an open spot can be very difficult. This is primarily impacts students who have classes later in the day. 

### Solution

This idea is built off the parking-reservation project that was mentioned during class. InsertName is an application that allows students to track availiable spots.

- when students arrive (presumably in the morning) they can input their stall number / location into the app
- when they leave, they can open the app and mark their spot as available
- students arriving later in the day (when the lot is almost full) can open the app and view a list of available spots, eliminting the need to endlessly circle the lot
- if the spot they take the spot, they can mark it as takan and it will be removed from the list of avaiable spots
