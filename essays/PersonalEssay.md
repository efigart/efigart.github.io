## Background

My interest in computer science originated at a young age. My first exposure was the Lego mindstorms set. I remember spending countless hours assembling pieces and writing code for it on my laptop. I really enjoyed the sandbox aspect of it, it felt like there was no limit to what I could build and program. I also liked having to problem-solve. There was a lot of trial and error involved but the feeling of finally arriving at a solution was unmatched. It really sparked my interest in coding. Today, my interests have shifted to learning and exploring languages, but I still feel the same excitement when I solve a challenging problem. 

## Pathway

After completing my freshman year, I decided to switch to the Security Science pathway of my degree. Cyber security captured my interest, I feel like it is an especially relevant field that will only continue to grow in the future. Specifically, I want to explore the process of securing programs and networks, as well as ethical hacking. I am also hoping it will make my post-graduation job search easier. 

## Attainable Goals 

One of my goals for this semester, and for the rest of my college career is to learn new languages, and expand on ones I already know. So far I only have experience with Java and C, and a little bit of React. I am planning to learn python on my own because I heard it is relevant to my potential career pathway. In addition, I am also hoping to apply what I have learned to projects or other experiences. As for practical skills, I would like to improve my collaboration and communication skills. I want to be able to function well in a team environment, I am hoping this class will help me. Ultimately, I aim to develop the technical and teamwork abilities necessary for a successful career in cyber security.
