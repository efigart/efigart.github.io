## Intro 

When I registered for this class last year, I did not know what to expect. I originally thought that we would primarily be building websites. This turned out to be true, but we also covered many other important topics. To start, we were introduced to a multitude of new coding languages such as Typescript and JavaScript. We also made use of libraries such as React, and frameworks like Next.js. Beyond the practice skills we also learned how to think and behave like a software engineer. Through the course of the final project. we were taught how to build, managa, and collaborate on software responsibly and effectively. Overall, this class taught me that software engineering isn't just about code, it is about solving problems, working with others, and utilizing good practices and descions.
