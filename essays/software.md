## Intro 

When I registered for this class last year, I did not know what to expect. I originally thought that we would primarily be building websites. This turned out to be true, but we also covered many other important topics. To start, we were introduced to a multitude of new coding languages such as Typescript and JavaScript. We also made use of libraries such as React, and frameworks like Next.js. Beyond the practice skills we also learned how to think and behave like a software engineer. Through the course of the final project. we were taught how to build, managa, and collaborate on software responsibly and effectively. Overall, this class taught me that software engineering isn't just about code, it is about solving problems, working with others, and utilizing good practices and descions. 

## Agile Project Management + Issue Driven Project Management 

Agile Project Management is a an approach to software development that emphasizes literative progress and team collaboration. It encourages breaking work into small, managable tasks that are continuously tracked and evaluated. This mindset was utilized by our group during the final project, especially when some parts of the code needed to be updated or fixed during or between milestones.

Specifically, we took advantage of Issue Driven Project Management. This is where deveopment work reloves around the Github issue tracker. Every task, issue, or bug fix was assigned to an issue. Each issue had a description of the task or problem, its own branch, and was assigned to a spefic person on the team. This method created tracability and accountability, everyone knew who was working on what and why.
