## Intro 

Artificial intelligence continues to have a large impact on education. On the surface, it may seem like a lazy way for students to "cheat" on their assignments, but it actually has a lot of practical applications that can extend traditonal learning. It can automate simple tasks, anaalyze example code, identify bugs, or even explain complex concepts. In ICS 314, I mainly utilized ChatGPT and Github Copilot. 

## Personal Expirence With Ai

### 1. Expirence WODS

For most of the expirence WODS I relied on the embedded video tutorial / explantion. I think that they were easy to follwo along and explained the topics well. However, a couple of the tutorials seemed kind-of dated, for those I think I did ask ChatGPT for help.

### 2. In-Class Practice WODS

For me, the point of these WODS was to test my current understanding of that week's topics. I did not utilize Ai because I wanted to see what I needed to improve on for the real WODs.

### 3. In-Class WODS

I think I use ChatGPT once or twice just to figure out the correct syntax or solve an ESLint erorr, but all of the logic of the code was written by me. 

### 4. Essays

I thought most of the essay topics were pretty simple, as a result, I found tha they were easy to write about. I don't think I would have found ChatGPT useful in this context.

### 5. Final Project 

Yes, I did utilzie ChatGPT for the final project. An example would be the "student-home page" that I worked on. I used ChatGPT to help me create my inital mockup. I did not give it a prompt like "create this page for me", instead, I input my react code and asked what css would be able to achieve the design elements I wanted. I thought this was a nice review from the html / css module earlier in the semester. Additonally, when it was time to implement functionality, I asked ChatGPT for help too. My goals was to pull data from the student + company schema and display it on the page, but this involved modifying the route.ts and authOptions.ts files. This was very complicated and took me over two hours to get working (with the help of ChatGPT). Overall, I would say my usage of it on this project was moderate, but I still gained a lot of experience and learned a lot. 

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial 

I think so, but I can't recall a specific example. I think this is one of the areas where ChatGPT can be very useful. It can explain it to you in multiple ways, something that a website tutorial or youtube video might not be able to do. 

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

I don't think I asked / answered a question in class or discord.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question 

I don't think I asked / answered a smart question.

### 9. Coding example
