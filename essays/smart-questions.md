Communication is a fundamental skill, especially in software development. Being able to ask the right questions is imperative when seeking help from peers or the open source community. The essay How to Ask Questions the Smart Way by Eric Raymond goes into detail about effective questioning. One of the main takeaways is asking yourself if asking a question is really necessary. There are many resources that are easily available to consult, a prominent example is ChatGPT or even a simple google search. These are likely to solve and maybe even expand on the problem you are facing. If those do not solve your problems, Raymond provides guidelines on how to ask an effective question. He recommends avoiding posting your question on an irrelevant forum, or asking too simple of a question. Doing so will increase the chance of you receiving a helpful response. 

Here is an example of a smart way to ask a question.
